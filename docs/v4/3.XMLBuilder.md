XML Builder can be used to parse a JS object into XML. 

XML Builder was the part of [fast-xml-parser](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-builder) for years. But considering that any bug in builder may false-alarm the users who are only using parser and vice-versa, we have decided to split it into a separate package.

Please visit [builder-docs](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-builder/blob/master/docs/README.md) for more information.

## Migration

To migrate to fast-xml-builder;

From
```js
import { XMLBuilder } from "fast-xml-parser";
```

To
```js
import  XMLBuilder  from "fast-xml-builder";
```

XMLBuilder will be removed from current package in any next major version of this library. So better to migrate.
